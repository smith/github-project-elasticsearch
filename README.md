# GitHub Projects Elasticsearch

_For Elastic internal use only. This is made for use by the @elastic/obs-ux-infra_services-team and may not work for you. Implementations are incomplete and ideas have not been thought through._

This repository has tools that help with this workflow:

- Export data from a GitHub Project.
- Add a timestamp to the data.
- Convert it into a format Elasticsearch can read.
- Import the data into Elasticsearch.

It's made for use with [The _ðŸ–¤ Everything Everything_ view on Obs UX: Infra & Services internal backlog](https://github.com/orgs/elastic/projects/1351/views/12).

See [[Spacetime] Measure team Flow Metrics](https://github.com/elastic/observability-dev/issues/3553) for more explanation and status of the project.
