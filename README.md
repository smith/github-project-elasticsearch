# GitHub Projects Elasticsearch

_For Elastic internal use only. This is made for use by the @elastic/obs-ux-infra_services-team and may not work for you. Implementations are incomplete and ideas have not been thought through._

This repository has tools that help with this workflow:

- Export data from a GitHub Project.
- Add a timestamp to the data.
- Convert it into a format Elasticsearch can read.
- Import the data into Elasticsearch.
